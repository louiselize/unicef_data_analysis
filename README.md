## Project: POC for UNICEF – Interactive GIS Map

This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates my ability to quickly create interactive maps using spatial and demographic data. The data used is synthetic, and the calculation of "High Exclusion Risk" is based on a simple, preliminary model, intended purely for this POC and not as a final result. It highlights areas of digital exclusion based on school locations, internet connectivity, and the presence of Roma students. Using Python and open-source tools, I’ve built a basic tool to identify high-risk areas, showcasing the technical skills needed for UNICEF’s efforts in addressing the digital gap and supporting equitable education.
